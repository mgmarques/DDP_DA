Shiny Application for Data Products | Coursera
==============================================

Repository with the shiny code for performing my application to attend the Peer Assessments of Developing Data Products | Coursera.

If you have some problem with the link https://mgmarques.shinyapps.io/DDP_DA/, you can dowload the directory DDP_DA found into this repo and open the DDP_DA.Rproj on Rstudio and run the application shiny::runApp() command.
